# Extra Credit 2 - DUE MAY 13th

Solve the following problem. Write up a paragraph explaining your thought process to solving this problem.


Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of arbitrary intervals.
Merge any overlapping intervals, and returns the new intervals in no
particular order.
```
Each interval is an array of two integers, with
interval[0]as the start of the interval and
interval[1] as the end of the interval.

Also note that the start of any particular interval will always be less than
or equal to the end of that interval.

EXAMPLE:
intervals =  = [[1, 2], [3, 5], [4, 7], [6, 8], [9, 10]]

Sample output should be:
[[1, 2], [3, 8], [9, 10]]

// Merge the intervals [3, 5], [4, 7], and [6, 8].
// The intervals could be ordered differently.

```
