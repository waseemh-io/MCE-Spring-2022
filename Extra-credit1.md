# Extra Credit 1

Write an introduction to blockchain. Clearly explain what is a blockchain, what is the purpose of blockchains and what are some of the problems they could solve for us. Explain the difference between Proof of Work and Proof of Stake. Donâ€™t just explain the difference between the two but dig into the details.

You may either write a report and this should be at least a page long.

Or you could create a video with a power point of you answering the questions above.
